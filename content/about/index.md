Hi! I am Tanvi Sudhalkar. A Front-end Developer/Software Developer by profession. I have 5 years of extensive experience with various roles at India's biggest IT company, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) after my bachelor's in Computer Engineering from Gujarat, India. I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, SQL, MySQL, Core Java, ReactJS, TypeScript, Communication and Leadership.

I am passionate about the work I am doing at my job which helps me learn more and help the company deliver better. I value honesty, transperency, integrity, accountability, work-life balance, inclusion and respect. Iâ€™m excited to collaborate with like-minded professionals who share the same passion for innovation and problem-solving.

I try to stay updated with latest technologies and build projects in free time.

I've recently moved to Canada. I live in Burlington, ON with my husband and a dog. My hobbies include dancing, singing, hiking, trekking, reading novels, etc. If I am not working on my PC or learning a new dance routine, then you'll find me in kitchen trying out new recipes. I consider myself as a cheerful and outgoing person.
